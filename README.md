# Cthulhu128 - 128b intro - Lovebyte Battlegrounds 2021

This repository contains the unpacked and mildly commented source for the TIC-80
128b intro cthulhu128, made by pestis / bC! and released at the Lovebyte
Battlegrounds 128b Fantasy Console compo.

The code is pretty self-explanatory; it's just layers of circles doing wobbly
sine patterns in polar coordinates. Some experimentation was done to find
parameters that avoid tentacles overlapping too badly.

Tested with TIC-80 0.90.1723, packed with
[pactic](https://github.com/phlubby/pactic). pactic should pack it down to 128
bytes. Remember to add -c option.

Greets: superogue, NuSan, psenough, p01, havoc, pactic authors and TIC-80 devs.
